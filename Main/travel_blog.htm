				<h2>Bhutan</h2>
				In Bhutan, there is a king who rides a bicycle up and down the mountains. Like many stories you will hear in this tiny Himalayan nation, it sounds like a fairy tale. In fact, it’s hard news. Jigme Singye Wangchuck, Bhutan’s fourth Druk Gyalpo, or Dragon King, is an avid cyclist who can often be found pedaling the steep foothills that ring the capital city, Thimphu. All Bhutanese know about the king’s passion for cycling, to which he has increasingly devoted his spare time since December 2006, when he relinquished the crown to his eldest son. In Thimphu, many tell tales of close encounters, or near-misses — the time they pulled over their car to chat with the bicycling monarch, the time they spotted him, or someone who looked quite like him, on an early-morning ride. If you spend any time in Thimphu, you may soon find yourself scanning its mist-mantled slopes. That guy on the mountain bike, darting out of the fog bank on the road up near the giant Buddha statue: Is that His Majesty?

				<h2>Sarpass</h2>
				The Sar Pass is in Parvati Valley of Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh, a state of India.
				Sar, in the local dialect, means a lake. While trekking, across the path from Tila Lotni to Biskeri Ridge, one has to pass by a small, (normally) frozen lake (Sar) and hence the name Sar Pass Trek.Trekking to the Himalayas in India is an experience of a lifetime and a mélange of adventure and self-realization! You’ll not only discover some beautiful places, but you will rediscover yourself amidst the beauty of the majestic Himalayan ranges! Just remember it’s not about the mountain we conquer, but ourselves. Every mountain is reachable if you just keep walking towards it. If your passion starts with adventure and trekking then this is the best way to get away from all that stress of the noisy cities. Take the adventure of trekking to Sar Pass, a place that offers eternal beauty, tranquility and adventure.
 				Take in the beauty of enchanting vistas of Kasol and start walking towards Grahan Village through verdant forest! Next day, the steeper trail into the forest will take you to the Nagaru Campsite.
